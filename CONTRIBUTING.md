## How to Report Issues

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.  
2. If you find a bug, click **New issue ‚Üí Bug Report** and include:  
   - A **title** describing the problem (‚Äú`python.py` prints extra newline‚Äù)  
   - Steps to reproduce and expected vs actual behavior  
   - Any error messages or screenshots  

3. For feature requests or enhancements, choose **New issue ‚Üí Feature Request**, and describe:  
   - What you‚Äôd like to see (e.g., ‚ÄúAdd TypeScript example‚Äù)  
   - Why it‚Äôs useful  

Use labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, or `good first issue` to help us triage.

## How to Propose a New Example or Improvement

1. **Fork** the repo and create a descriptive branch name:  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/Multilanguage-Test-Examples.git
   cd Multilanguage-Test-Examples
   git checkout -b add-rust-iterator-example
   ```
2. **Add your example** under the root directory, following the naming convention:  
   ```
   <language>.<extension>
   ```
   - e.g. `elm.elm`, `typescript.ts`, `dart_extras.dart`
3. **Include at the top** of your file a block comment with:
   - File name & language  
   - What the example covers (loops, functions, I/O, etc.)  
   - How to compile/run, e.g.  
     ```bash
     # Rust
     rustc rust_iterator.rs && ./rust_iterator
     ```
4. **Write clear inline comments** on each construct you demonstrate.
5. **Save and commit** your changes:
   ```bash
   git add my_language.ext
   git commit -m "feat: add <Language> example covering X, Y, Z"
   ```

## Coding Style & File Structure

- **Naming**: one file per language, lowercase, matching extension.  
- **Comments**: use the idiomatic comment syntax for each language.  
- **Formatting**: follow the community conventions (e.g., `gofmt`, `rustfmt`, `prettier`).  
- **Content**: keep examples short (‚â§ 40 lines), focused on fundamentals:
  1. Hello-world / basic output  
  2. Variables & types  
  3. Control flow (if/else, loops)  
  4. Functions/methods  
  5. (Optional) Basic error handling or input  

---

## Running & Testing Locally

We recommend a simple script to compile and run all examples. You can create your own, for instance:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
for f in *.*; do
  case "${f##*.}" in
    c)    gcc "$f" -o out && ./out ;;
    cpp)  g++ "$f" -o out && ./out ;;
    py)   python3 "$f" ;;
    java) javac "$f" && java "${f%.java}" ;;
    js)   node "$f" ;;
    # ‚Ä¶ add other languages here ‚Ä¶
  esac
  rm -f out
done
echo "All examples ran successfully!"
```

Save it as `scripts/run_all.sh`, make executable (`chmod +x`), then:

```bash
./scripts/run_all.sh
```

## Creating a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin add-rust-iterator-example
   ```
2. On GitHub, click **Compare & pull request**.  
3. Fill out the template:
   - **Title**: concise and descriptive (`feat: <Language> example for ...`)  
   - **Description**: link any related issues, briefly explain what you‚Äôve added/fixed  
4. Assign relevant labels (`enhancement`, `bug`, etc.) if you have permission.  
5. Submit ‚Äî your PR will enter our review queue.

## Review Process & CODEOWNERS

- We use [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) to auto-assign reviewers for files under their domain.  
- Once your PR is open, you‚Äôll see **Review requested** on the right sidebar.  
- Reviewers will check:
  - Code correctness & idiomatic style  
  - Clarity of comments & instructions  
  - That the example runs without errors  

We aim to review within 48 hours‚Äîthanks for your patience!
