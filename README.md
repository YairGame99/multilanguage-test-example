# Multilanguage Test Examples

Welcome to the **Multilanguage Test Examples** repository! This project contains simple, self-contained examples of programming fundamentals implemented in various programming languages. Each example demonstrates basic constructs—including output, variable declarations, conditionals, loops, and functions/methods—with clear inline comments to help you learn and run the code quickly.
